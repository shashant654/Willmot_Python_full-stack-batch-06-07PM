# what is function in python =>



def my_function():
    print("This is Suhani")
    print("this is Nisha")
    print("this is Sharik")

print("This is the first time i am calling my function")
my_function()  # function call


a = 5
b = 10
print("The sum of a and b is : ", a + b)
print("it's the second time i am calling my function")
my_function()  # function call

for i in range(3):
                    print("i")
print("it's the third time i am calling my function")
my_function() 



=> the main advantage of function is code reusability.
=> once we define a function, we can call it multiple times.
that's how we can save our time and effort.
=> it enahnces code readability.
