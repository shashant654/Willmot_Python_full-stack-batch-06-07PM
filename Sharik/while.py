# for loop:-

# => it is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.

# => whenever we have to access each and every element of sequence one by one then we can use for loop.



## list , tuple, string => these are squence data types


# listt = [ "Suhani" , "Nisha" , "Wilmot" ]
# stringg ="wilmot is  nice guy."

# tuplee = ( "Suhani" , "Nisha" , "Wilmot" )                  

# for i in listt:
#                     print(i)


# my_string = "Programming"
# for char_variable in my_string:
#                     print(char_variable)




# my_name = "sharik"
# print(my_name[1])  # h


# listt = [ "Suhani" , "Nisha" , "Wilmot" ]

# for i in listt:
#                     print(i)


for i in range(1,11):   
                    print(i)


step 1 => initialization => i = 1
step 2 => condition check => i in range(1,11) => TRUE
step 3 => body execution => print(i) => 1
step 4 => update => i = i + 1 => i = 2
step 5 => repeat => condition check => i in range(1,11) => TRUE
