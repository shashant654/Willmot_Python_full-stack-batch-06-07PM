# ## WHat is loop?
# => whenever we have to perform any repeated task, 
# we should prefer loop.

# Types:-

# 1. for loop
# 2. while loop

# 3. do while loop => not available in python


# for loop in c languages:-

# for i in range(5):
#     print("Sharik")


# output section : 
# Sharik
# Sharik
# Sharik
# Sharik
# Sharik

# for my_variable in range(5):
#     print("Sharik")

for my_variable in range( 0, 5):
                    print("Sharik")

# in this  loop :
# my_variable => loop variable
# range(0,5) => loop range

# => in range function 0 is starting point  and 5 is ending point.
# the starting point is by default 0.
# => the ending point is exclusive.

# print("Sharik") => it is the task to be performed repeatedly.


# for my_variable in range(10):
#     print("Suhani")


my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for my_character in my_string:
