# # # tuple:- 
# A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable (cannot be changed), and indexable collection of elements.

# You can store different data types (integers, strings, lists, etc.) inside a tuple.

# it is also immutable data strucutre.

# Example: ( 11, 22, 33, 44)



# # Empty tuple
# t1 = ()

# # Tuple with mixed data types
# t2 = (1, "Hello", 3.5, True)

# # Tuple without parentheses (packing)
# t3 = 1, 2, 3

# # Tuple with one element (note the comma!)
# t4 = (10)


# Tuple methods :-

# my_last_tuple = (11, 222, 332, 22, 444, 255,22, 22, 33, 33)

# print(my_last_tuple.count(22))    # 3
# print(my_last_tuple.index(33))   # 8





my_tuple = (22,33,44,55,66)
print(my_tuple[0]) # 22

my_new_tuple = ("wilmot", "sharik", 55, 88, 9.7, "kuhh bhi")
print(my_new_tuple)

print(my_tuple[4])  # 66

# my_tuple[4]  = 888

print(my_tuple)


#   0   1   2   3   4
# (22, 33 ,44, 55, 66)


# my_list = [ "wilmot", "sharik", 55, 88, 9.7, "kuhh bhi"]
