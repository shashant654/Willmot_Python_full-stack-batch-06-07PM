# OOPS programming?

# object oriented programming .



# OOPS => it stands for object oriented programming.



# c lanague does not support OOPS programming.
# but c++ , java , python , Javascript , PHP support OOPS programming.



# class Student:

#             student_name = "SHarik"  # this is local variable

#             def student_info(self):
#                     print("Student name is :", self.student_name)

# # 
# # print(student_name)   # error because student_name is local variable
# print(Student.student_name)  # correct way to access local variable

# student_info() # error because student_info is local function




# class Student:

#             student_name = "SHarik"  # this is local variable

#             def student_info(self):
#                     print("Student name is :", self.student_name)


# my_object = Student()  # creating object of class Student
# print(my_object.student_name)   # Sharik

# my_object.student_info()  # calling method of class Student



# NOTE: to access any method or any variable of any class , then you have to create object of that class firstly .

# function or MEthod , both are same thing.

1. class 
2. object
3. Four Pillors of OOPS programming 
   a. Inheritance
   b. Polymorphism
   c. Encapsulation
   d. Abstraction


int i = 78  => i have to explain 3 things ( data type , variable , value)

i = 88 => we have to explain 2 things ( variable , value)
