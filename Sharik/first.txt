## what , where, who, when, why 

5W things . 

1. what is Python?
=> Python is a high level interpreted Programming Language. 

## THere are two types of Programming Language

1. High Level Language :
=> it is software oriented/related.
=> it is used in Web devlopment, data science , game devlopment, app devlopment etc.
EXAMPLE : Python, Java , c++ etc.

2. Low Level Language :

in Neitherland. 


the task is we have to print Hello Wilmot.

## why:
1. it is easy to learn and use. 
2. it is easy to read and understand.
3. it is used in web devlopment, app devlopment,
data science, Machine learning, etc.
4. it is cross platform(Operating system). 
=> when we build a website using Python language , then it can be opened in Windows as well as mac Operating sytem. 

5. it has a large ecosystem.
=> it has many frmaework or library ( Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas etc.)
