## Operators:
=> it can perform any specific operation between two values/Operands.


4 + 5 => it can perform addition 
4 * 5 => it can perform multiplication 

=> 4 and  5 => are values/Operands 
=> +, *, - =>  are the operators



Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Membership Operators
7. Identity Operators
# ------------------------------------------------ 

1. Arithmetic Operators:
=> it is used to perform mathematical operations between two values/Operands.

Operators: +, -, *, /, %, //, **

+ => Addition
- => Subtraction
* => Multiplication
/ => Division
% => Modulus
// => Floor Division
** => Exponentiation

3**6 => 3^6 => 3*3*3*3*3*3 => 729

4**2 => 4*4 = 16


## Division operator ("/") => it gives us Quient value.
=> it includes the decimal part.

Ex: 3.5, 4.6, 4.1, 2.5 etc. 

## Floor Division ("//") => it gives us Quient value.
=> it removes the decimal part .

## Modulus ("%") => it gives us the remainder part .


2. Assignment Operator : =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
# = => Assignment
# += => Add and Assign
# -= => Subtract and Assign
# *= => Multiply and Assign             
# /= => Divide and Assign
# %= => Modulus and Assign
# //= => Floor Divide and Assign
# **= => Exponent and Assign


x = 20
y = 5
# x += y  
x = x + y 
print(x)



3. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=

x = 20
y = 5
# x += y  
x = x + y 
print(x)


# the task is we wanna add in x => both  X and Y 
# x = x + y => it takes more time to run 
# x += y  => it takes less time to run 
# print(x + y) 

# in future we will learn about Time complexity, Space complexity

4. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# ------------------------ 
# => in this case we will get the output in boolean format => True, False

5. Logical Operators: and, or, not

# and => both the conditions should be true
# or => any one condition should be true
# not => negates the condition



6. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# & =>  Bitwise AND
# | =>  Bitwise OR           
# ^ =>  Bitwise XOR
# ~ =>  Bitwise NOT

0 => 0000
1=> 0001
2 => 0010
3 => 0011
4 => 0100
5 => 0101
6 => 0110
7 => 0111
8 => 1000
9 => 1001
10 => 1010 => A
11 => 1011 => B
12 => 1100 => C
13 => 1101 => D
14 => 1110 => E
15 => 1111 => F
